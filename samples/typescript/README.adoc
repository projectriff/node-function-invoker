*Invoker*:: Node
*Function*:: link:lib/greeter.ts[greeter.ts]
*Input*:: greeter

=== prerequisites

1. riff is deployed
2. the `riff` CLI is on your PATH
3. the node invoker is installed

   riff invokers apply -f https://github.com/projectriff/node-function-invoker/raw/master/node-invoker.yaml

4. the working directory is `samples/typescript`

=== how it works

When a node function contains a package.json file, the package dependencies are installed while
building the function into a Docker container. This function installs typescript as a dependency
and then uses a post install script to run the typescript compiler. Once the typescript is
transpiled, the function behavaes as a standard JS function.

=== create the function and its input topic

```
riff create node -i greeter
```

=== publish a message and wait for a reply

```
riff publish -i greeter -d "riff user" -r
```

=== delete the function and its input topic

```
riff delete --all
```
